POSTGRE SQL:

SELECT w1
FROM 
(SELECT SPLIT_PART(words1, ',', 1) AS w1
FROM google_word_lists
UNION 
SELECT SPLIT_PART(words1, ',', 2) AS w1
FROM google_word_lists
UNION
SELECT SPLIT_PART(words1, ',', 3) AS w1
FROM google_word_lists) a

INTERSECT 

select w2 
from 
(SELECT SPLIT_PART(words2, ',', 1) AS w2
FROM google_word_lists
UNION 
SELECT SPLIT_PART(words2, ',', 2) AS w2
FROM google_word_lists
UNION
SELECT SPLIT_PART(words2, ',', 3) AS w2
FROM google_word_lists) b

-- the above code gives a list which logically is correct but isn't the expected output. Maybe I should send this bug issue to stratascratch for resolution
