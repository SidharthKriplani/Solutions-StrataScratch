PYTHON:
df = employee.groupby(['department'], as_index = False)['salary'].mean()
# without using as_index = False I was not getting department names, just pandas series to give me the avg salary values

df = df.rename(columns = {'department': 'department', 'salary': 'avg_salary'})
# above will give a syntax error if I use [] instead of {}

pd.merge(df, employee, on = 'department')[['department', 'first_name', 'salary', 'avg_salary']]
# remember, when using names of multiple columns, use double [] instead of single []
