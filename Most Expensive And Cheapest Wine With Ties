SELECT region_1, variety, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY region_1 ORDER BY price DESC) AS rankk
FROM winemag_pd
WHERE region_1 IS NOT NULL
), 

cheapest AS
(
SELECT region_1, variety, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY region_1 ORDER BY price ASC) AS rankk
FROM winemag_pd
WHERE region_1 IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT DISTINCT expensive.region_1, expensive.variety AS most_expensive_variety, cheapest.variety AS cheapest_variety
FROM expensive
JOIN cheapest 
ON expensive.variety = cheapest.variety
ORDER BY 1 DESC
