This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data engineering positions at Chama.

Chama is a relatively new, modern company, with an IOS App and Android App. To grow our company we must make a special effort in collecting all information available around the App and make it available for everyone in the company. Some information about App usage is generated by our App and our backend API. Other sources of information, like the Google Play Store, can provide very useful insights on App performance and user rating. Chama is very data-oriented and, most decisions are made based on appropriate metrics, therefore, data quality is a must and a concern of everyone involved.

Assignment
Some event data come as json files and need some transformation to be structured as tables. Convert the case.json file to 3 csv files, using the programming language of your choice, with the following rules:

Data Description
You are given one file case.json. Below is an example of a single record from this file:

{
    "EnqueuedTimeUtc": "2021-09-05 08:04:08 UTC",
    "EventName": "DynamicPrice_Result",
    "Payload": "{\"provider\":\"ApplyDynamicPriceRange\",\"offerId\":\"a6611d55-9624-4381-8cdd-323ee3689241\",\"algorithmOutput\":{\"min_global\":85.0,\"min_recommended\":87.2,\"max_recommended\":97.65,\"differenceMinRecommendMinTheory\":2.2}}"
  }


Practicalities
Make sure that the solution reflects your entire thought process - it is more important how the code is structured rather than the final CSV files.
