This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data science positions at Lyft.

Assignment
After exploring and analyzing the data, please:

Recommend a Driver's Lifetime Value (i.e., the value of a driver to Lyft over the entire projected lifetime of a driver).
Please answer the following questions:
What are the main factors that affect a driver's lifetime value?
What is the average projected lifetime of a driver? That is, once a driver is onboarded, how long do they typically continue driving with Lyft?
Do all drivers act alike? Are there specific segments of drivers that generate more value for Lyft than the average driver?
What actionable recommendations are there for the business?
Prepare and submit a writeup of your findings for consumption by a cross-functional audience.
You can make the following assumptions about the Lyft rate card:

Base Fare $2.00
Cost per Mile $1.15
Cost per Minute $0.22
Service Fee $1.75
Minimum Fare $5.00
Maximum Fare $400.00
Data Description
You'll find three CSV files attached with the following data:

driver_ids.csv

driver_id Unique identifier for a driver
driver_onboard_date Date on which driver was on-boarded
ride_ids.csv

driver_id Unique identifier for a driver
ride_id Unique identifier for a ride that was completed by the driver
ride_distance Ride distance in meters
ride_duration Ride duration in seconds
ride_prime_time Prime Time applied on the ride
ride_timestamps.csv

ride_id Unique identifier for a ride
event describes the type of event; this variable takes the following values:
requested_at - passenger requested a ride
accepted_at - driver accepted a passenger request
arrived_at - driver arrived at pickup point
picked_up_at - driver picked up the passenger
dropped_off_at - driver dropped off a passenger at destination
timestamp Time of event
You can assume that:

All rides in the data set occurred in San Francisco
All timestamps in the data set are in UTC
Practicalities
Please work on the questions in the displayed order. Make sure that the solution reflects your entire thought process - it is more important how the code is structured rather than the final answers. You are expected to spend no more than 2 hours solving this project.This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data science positions at Lyft.
