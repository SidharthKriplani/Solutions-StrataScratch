POSTGRE SQL:

SELECT acquired_quarter, COUNT(*) AS cnt   
FROM crunchbase_acquisitions
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1, 2 DESC


PYTHON:
crunchbase_acquisitions = crunchbase_acquisitions.groupby('acquired_quarter', as_index = False).size().rename(columns = {'size': 'cnt'})
crunchbase_acquisitions = crunchbase_acquisitions.sort_values(['acquired_quarter', 'cnt'], ascending = [True, False])
crunchbase_acquisitions

-- there is just one issue. The value of 'acquired_quarter' is different in SQL and in Python. So the Python solution is not getting accepted. The funny thing is, this 
problem is an EASY SQL problem, but a HARD Python problem. So maybe that is the reason I can't just convert my above SQL solution to Python and have it accepted
